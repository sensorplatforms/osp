LPC5410x UART polling example using the ROM API
=================================

Example description
-------------------
This example shows how to configure UART in polling
mode using the ROM-based APIs and do data transfers.


This demo sends and receives data via UART in 115200 baud. This program also
demonstrates sending BREAK condition with and without dataloss.

Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
Connect UART (FTDI) cabe to the board at J10, and open a teraterm emulation
program to send/receive the data.
