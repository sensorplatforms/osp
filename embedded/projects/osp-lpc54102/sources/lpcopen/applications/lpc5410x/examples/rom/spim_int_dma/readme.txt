LPC5410x SPI master with DMA ROM API example
============================

Example description
-------------------
This example shows how to use the SPI master ROM API to setup and perform
a SPI master transfer in interrupt mode. The DMA ROM API is used with
this example to setup the SPI for DMA based operation for both the
transmit and receive buffers.

Special connection requirements
-------------------------------
This example uses loopback mode and has no special setup requirements.
However, the SPI master signals can be monitored on pins P0.11, P0.12,
P0.13, and P0.14.
