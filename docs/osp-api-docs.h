  \mainpage Overview

 This documentation describes the Open-Sensor-Platform (OSP) project
 for a resource constrained Sensor Hub or Smart Sensor device. The
 following figures show the aspects of OSP provided in Android and in an
 embedded core.

<h2>High Level Usage Overview</h2>
At boot time:
  - get sensor calibration data from non-volatile memory or the host
  - call OSP_Initialize()
  - let the Library know about what sensors are on the system by filling in a SensorDescriptor_t and calling OSP_RegisterInputSensor() for each sensor

During steady state operation:
  - queue data from sensor ISRs by calling OSP_SetData()
  - execute primary fusion computation by calling OSP_DoForegroundProcessing() at least twice as fast as your max expected output rate 
  - execute calibration computation by calling OSP_DoBackgroundProcessing() at least as fast as your min expected output rate
  - as enable commands come from the host construct an appropriate SensorDescriptor_t and call OSP_SubscribeOutputSensor() to start receiving data callbacks
  - as disable commands come from the host call OSP_UnsubscribeOutputSensor()
  - as setDelay commands come from the host do an appropriate OSP_UnsubscribeOutputSensor(), update the OutputDataRate, then call OSP_SubscribeOutputSensor()

Data will be returned via callbacks:
  - Sensor fusion will call your callbacks with output sensor data (Device Orientation Rotation Vector, Calibrated Magnetometer Data, etc)
  - ResourceManager will provide callbacks for enabling/disabling/rate changing input sensor drivers
  - Errors and warnings are also available via callbacks
  - When sensor calibration callbacks fire, store the calibration parameters to non-volatile memory locally or on the host
