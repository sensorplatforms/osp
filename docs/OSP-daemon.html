	KEYn.tag=value
<p>
	Where KEY is:
<dl>
	<dt>system
	<dt>output
	<dd>This configures a sensor with data created or passed out by the daemon. It is for outbound data.
	<dt>input
	<dd>This configures a sensor that feeds data into the daemon. The data
can be consumed and processed by algs and/or it can be merely copied out to an outbound sensor. 
</dl>
	n is an integer from 0 to 99. Each KEY has its own number space.<br>
		This number is used to identify all the attributes related
		to that entity. It is also used to reference the entity.

<H2>Valid lines</H2>
<dl>
	<dt>output0.name and input0.name
	<dd>This defines the name of the sensor. Exact usage depends on the
driver.
	<ul>
		<li>For input event drivers, this is the name of the input
device. For the outbound case, this is the name created. For the inbound case,
this is the name to look for.
		<li>For iio drivers, this is the name of the iio device to 
look for.
		<li>For file oriented drivers, this is the name of the file to
read from or create/append. 
	</ul>

	<dt>output0.type and input0.type
	<dd>This defines the type of sensor for output and input purposes. It
should be a string like SENSOR_ACCELEROMETER. The name is defined by the
enumerated type in OSP. Outbound sensors will come from either another 
inbound sensor or from the algs.

	<dt>output0.driver and input0.driver
	<dd>This defines the driver associated with the entity. 

	<dt>input0.copy
	<dd>Defines an output sensor to send a copy of the data to. Value
is the name of the output entity. For example:<p>
input0.copy=output1<p>
This will send a copy of data received on the input0 entity to output1 without
any transformation.

	<dt>input0.swap
	<dd>This defines how the 3 axises from the input sensor will be 
handled when it is process by the alg. This is specified by providing 3 
comma seperated numbers: 0, 1, and 2 representing X, Y, and Z respectively.
The order is X, Y, Z. Examples:<p>
	<ul>
		<li>No change: 0,1,2
		<li>Swap X and Y: 1,0,2
	</ul>
	<dt>input0.convert
	<dd>Define a conversion factor for each axis. This number is multiplied
by the data prior being used. The number is a floating point value. The value can be provided in 2 formats.
<ol>
	<li>A single value. The same value is applied to all 3 axis.
	<li>3 common seperated values. Each axis can have a unique value.
</ol>
This value is typically used to scale and if needed invert an axis.
	<dt>input0.noise
	<dd>Define a noise value for each axis. The number is a floating point value. The value can be provided in 2 formats.
<ol>
	<li>A single value. The same value is applied to all 3 axis.
	<li>3 common seperated values. Each axis can have a unique value.
</ol>
This value is used by the algs.
	<dt>output0.noprocess
	<dd>Value is ignored. This attribute prevents the alg version of a 
sensor from being used. For example, if there is an inbound data source for
SENSOR_ACCELEROMETER and the alg also provides a SENSOR_ACCELEROMETER (prehaps
as a calibrated or otherwise modified), this attribute will for the usage of
the version directly from the inbound data source. Unless there is a corresponding copy from an inbound sensor, this output entity will preoduce no data.
	<dt>input0.noprocess
	<dd>Value is ignored. This attribute prevents the inbound data from
being submitted to the algs. Unless there is a copy attibute, the data from
this sensor is ignored.
	<dt>output0.format
	<dd>Modifies the value to fit a particular output format. This is
used with the noprocess option. Valid options are:
	<dl>
		<dt>integer
		<dd>Data is not modified.
		<dt>float
		<dd>Data is converted to a float first then the binary contents
of the float is sent.
		<dt>shift24
		<dd>Shift data by 24 bits.
		<dt>shift16
		<dd>Shift data by 16 bits.
		<dt>shift15
		<dd>Shift data by 15 bits.
		<dt>shift12
		<dd>Shift data by 12 bits.
	</dl>
	<dt>input0.option, output0.option
	<dd>This defines configuration option for the driver. Parameter is
a value. Values beginning with 0x are considered to be hex. Meaning of the
value depends on the driver. Currently, only the input event output driver
uses this:
	<ul>
		<li>bit 0: Enable embedded time stamps. 64 bit time stamps
as passed as ABS_THROTTLE (upper 32 bits)/ABS_RUDDER (lower 32bits)
		<li>bit 1: Enable sending the 4th element of a quaternion.
This value is passed as ABS_WHEEL.
		<li>bit 2: Enable dittering of the output to defeat the input
subsystem's duplicate value elimination. It adds a value from 0-2 to each
data.
	</ul>
	<dt>system0.calfile
	<dd>This defines the name of the file to write cal data to. The
	last one specified will be used. Relative path are relative to the
process working directory. To avoid surprises, use absolute paths.
	<dt>system0.pmdir
	<dd>Define a directory for enabling/disabling sensors. A path in a
tmpfs is highly desireable to minimize flash wear.
